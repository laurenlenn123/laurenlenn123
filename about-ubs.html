<h2>Mission of the Organization</h2>

<p>
Founded in 1968, United Black Students (UBS) aims to expose all members of the University of Miami community
to the many facets of African American culture. Concurrently, we serve to unite, empower, and
uplift African Americans through cultural, professional, and personal events and initiatives.
