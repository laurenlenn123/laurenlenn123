 <h2>
  Here is a little bit about me!
</h2>

<p> My name is Lauren Lennon and I am a junior from Pennsylvania double majoring in Broadcast Journalism and Psychology.
Some of my involvements on campus include Co-President of the United Black Students Organization, Resident Assistant in Hecht, and a P100 Tour Guide.
</p>

<p>I am taking this class because I took a previous course a couple semesters ago that was intro to web design (I forget the class code) but during that class  realised that I do like code and would love to build my coding skills!
</p>

<p> Random fact about me: my favorite color is red, however, I do like the color lilac a lot too. I like the color red because I feel like it's a color that can go with anything!
